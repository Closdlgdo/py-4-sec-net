A function is a block of code that performs a specific task when the function is invoked. You can use functions to make
your code reusable, better organized, and more readable. Functions can have parameters and return values. There are at
least four basic types of functions in Python:
• Built-in functions: These are an integral part of Python. You can see a complete list of Python’s built-in functions
at https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html.
• Functions that come from pre-installed modules.
• User-defined functions: These are written by developers in their own code, and they use
them freely in Python.
• The lambda function: This allows us to create anonymous functions that are built using
expressions such as product = lambda x,y : x * y, where lambda is a Python keyword and x and y are the function parameters.

 In Python, functions include reusable code-ordered blocks. This allows a developer to write a block of code to perform
a single action. Although Python offers several built-in features, a developer may build user-defined functionality.
Python functions are defined using the def keyword with the function name, followed by the function parameters. The
function’s body is composed of Python statements to be executed. You have the option to return a value to the function
caller at the end of the function, or if you do not assign a return value, it will return the None value by default.
