Python is an object-oriented language that allows you to create classes from descriptions and instantiate them.
The functions specified inside the class are instance methods, also known as member functions.
Pythonâ€™s way of constructing objects is via the class keyword. A Python object is an assembly of methods, variables,
and properties. Lots of objects can be generated with the same class de- scription. Here is a simple example of a
protocol object definition.
