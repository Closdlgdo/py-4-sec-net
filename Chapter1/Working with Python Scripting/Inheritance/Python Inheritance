Python inheritance is an important concept in object-oriented programming languages. This feature means creating a new
class that inherits all the functionality of the parent class and allows the new class to add additional functionality
to the base functionality.

In object-oriented terminology, when class “X” is inherited by class “Y”, “X” is called a Super Class or Base Class and
“Y” is called a Subclass or Derived Class. One more fact to keep in mind is that only the fields and methods that are
not private are accessible by the Derived Class. Private fields and methods are only accessible by the class itself.

Python also supports multilevel inheritance, which allows the child class to have inheritance below it. That means the
base class is the parent class of all sub-classes and inheritance goes from parent to child. In this way, child classes
can access properties and methods from parent classes, but parent classes cannot access the properties of the child class.

Advantages of Python inheritance
One of the main advantages is code reuse, allowing us to establish a relationship between classes, avoiding the need to
re-declare certain methods or attributes.

Classes allow us to build objects on top of a collection of abstractly defined attributes and meth- ods. And the ability
to inherit will allow us to create larger and more capable child classes by inheriting multiple attributes and methods
from others as well as more specific controlling the same for a single class.

The following are some benefits of using inheritance in Python’s object-oriented programming:
• Python inheritance provides code reusability, readability, and scalability.
• Reduce code repetition. You can define all the methods and attributes in the parent class that are accessible by the
child classes.
• By dividing the code into multiple classes, identifying bugs in applications is easier.
