Python inheritance is an important concept in object-oriented programming languages. This feature means creating a new
class that inherits all the functionality of the parent class and allows the new class to add additional functionality
to the base functionality.

In object-oriented terminology, when class “X” is inherited by class “Y”, “X” is called a Super Class or Base Class and
“Y” is called a Subclass or Derived Class. One more fact to keep in mind is that only the fields and methods that are
not private are accessible by the Derived Class. Private fields and methods are only accessible by the class itself.
