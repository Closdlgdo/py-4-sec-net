# Single inheritance occurs when a child class inherits the attributes and methods of a single parent class. The
# following is an example of simple inheritance in Python where we have a base class and a child class that inherits
# from the parent class. Note the presence of the __init__ method in both classes , which allows you to initialize the
# properties of the class as an object constructor.
