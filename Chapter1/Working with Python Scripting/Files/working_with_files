When working with files it is important to be able to move through the filesystem, determine the type of file, and open
a file in the different modes offered by the operating system.

The following properties of the file object can be accessed:
• closed: Returns True if the file has been closed. Otherwise, False. • mode: Returns the opening mode.
• name: Returns the name of the file
• encoding: Returns the character encoding of a text file.
• newlines: Returns the newline character used in the file.
