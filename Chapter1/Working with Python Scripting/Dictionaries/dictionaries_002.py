# Each key must be unique: That means it is not possible to have more than one key of the same value.
# • A key may be a number or a string.
# • A dictionary is not a list: A list contains a set of numbered values, while a dictionary
# holds pairs of values.
# • The len() function: This works for dictionaries and returns the number of key-value elements in the dictionary.
